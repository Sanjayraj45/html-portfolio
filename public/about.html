<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a dedicated and driven engineering student currently in my 4th semester at VTU. My academic focus is on Computer Organization and Data Structures & Algorithms, where I continuously expand my knowledge in system design and computational problem-solving. I have a strong interest in operating systems, IoT network topologies, and amplifier performance, including feedback mechanisms and operational amplifier specifications like slew rate.

  I prefer concise and direct communication, valuing efficiency in learning and problem-solving. As a tech-savvy individual, I use my ASUS TUF F15 laptop to enhance my studies and practical knowledge. My commitment to continuous learning and self-improvement reflects in both my academic and personalÂ pursuits.</p>
